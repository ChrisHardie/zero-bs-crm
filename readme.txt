= Free, but supported =
<p>Did we already tell you ZBS is free? Well it is.</p>

<p>We support ZBS, (update it, fix it, love it, refine it), because we use it ourselves everyday. ZBS is a gift back to this WordPress community we love, it's a gift to you.</p>

<p>The world is full of people seeking to take your cash, but WordPress entrepreneurs and small biz can't waste time with bloated paid solutions, we deserve an easier start. We give this to you because life's too short to use overcomplex expensive software from the get go. Maybe there's a time for that, we're not sure, but for most successful entrepreneurs we know, simple & practical is the winning combo.</p>

<p>So that's the story. <strong>Zero BS CRM is free. Totally.</strong> There's some extensions we sell, stuff like 'mail campaigns', but they're relatively cheap, ($27-$129, or everything for $199).</p>

<p>To that end we'll keep this updated. Throw us suggestions, grab an <a href="https://zerobscrm.com/extensions">extension</a>, or simply use the free ZBS Core CRM to make your businesses better. Tell people. We're here for win-win business :)</p>

= Updates for Life = 
See at the top it says 'last updated' - I bet we updated fairly recently, eh? But guess what? We're not adding useless features to slow down your CRM. We only fix bugs, remove friction, and add much-requested simple & practical features. Our updates are usually refinements, improving our existing CRM functionality until it's the best it can possibly be, rather than adding useless distracting features.



<blockquote> 
= Made by Professionals, backed by Automattic =
<p>Mike and Woody are the people behind ZBS CRM. We've been here a while. Between us we're probably accountable for a few million WordPress-related downloads. We've built a lot over the years 50+ plugins, 10+ themes. We make our living through WordPress. In July 2019 Automattic recognised the value of ZBS CRM and [acquired our company](https://zerobscrm.com/zbs-blog/entrepreneurs/weve-joined-automattic/). Now we're tooling up to make this the best CRM going.</p>


<p>*And we both use ZBSCRM every day!</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any limits to customer counts in ZBS? =

There are absolutely no limits in Zero BS CRM, apart from the usual ones applied by your host (database size etc.)

= Can I develop on top of ZBS? =

Of course. Please reach out to us via the in-plugin feedback page if you want to, we'll help you get started, or check out our [Developer resources](https://zerobscrm.com/feature/developer-ready/).

= Is ZBS really free? = 

Totally. The core is a solid, useful, Customer Relationship Manager right out of the box. You don't need anything else to get started managing your leads, and customers. We do build extensions, (because we need them), but they're not at all essential. Further, they're cheap in comparison to the pay-per-month CRM options, and you actually own them, yourself.

= Where can I see the CRM extensions? = 

Here: https://zerobscrm.com/extension-bundles/

= Why host your own CRM in WordPress? = 

Data-privacy, control, extendibiliy. You're probably already paying for hosting too, so you'll save there. SaaS has its place, but there's so much value in hosting your own.

= How do I get my existing customers into ZBS? = 

The free core has a basic CSV Importer which works well. You can also use our extensions: CSV Importer, or one of the Sync's (PayPal Sync, Woo Sync, or Stripe Sync) - these automatically pull in all of your customer data (including transactions) and then keeps it up to date for you!

= Do you have a B2B mode? = 

Yep, that's an option in the settings.
Enabling Business-to-Business mode adds a "Companies" layer, which lets you have contacts under a company.

= How long are you going to support this for? = 

We use this CRM ourselves every day. We're here for the long term. (And we're constantly improving it!)
